.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads log data generated by
.Xr flytrap 8
and outputs the same data in the Internet Storm Center's DShield submission format.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d
Enable log messages at debug level or higher.
.It Fl f Ar date
Ignore log entries older than the specified date, which can be an ISO
8601 date with or without separators, an ISO 8601 time with or without
separators, or an ISO 8601 datetime with or without separators.
A time or datetime may be followed by a
.Sq Z
to specify UTC; otherwise, the local timezone is used.
If a date is provided without a time, 00:00:00 is assumed.
If a time is provided without a date, today's date is assumed, even if
the result lies in the future.
.It Fl h
Print a usage message and exit.
.It Fl I Ar a.b.c.d Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d/p
Include log entries for traffic originating from the specified IPv4
address, range or subnet.
.It Fl i Ar a.b.c.d Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d/p
Include log entries for traffic addressed to the specified IPv4
address.
.It Fl o Ar output
Write to the specified file instead of
.Va stdout .
.It Fl r Ar recipient
When printing an email header, use the specified recipient instead of
.Aq Mt reports@dshield.org .
Only valid in conjunction with the
.Fl s
option.
.It Fl s Ar sender
Print an email header before the log data, so the output can be passed
directly to an email submission client such as
.Xr mailx 1 .
.It Fl u Ar userid
Use the specified DShield user ID instead of 0.
This option is required if the
.Fl s
option is used.
.It Fl t Ar date
Ignore log entries newer than the specified date, which can be an ISO
8601 date with or without separators, an ISO 8601 time with or without
separators, or an ISO 8601 datetime with or without separators.
A time or datetime may be followed by a
.Sq Z
to specify UTC; otherwise, the local timezone is used.
If a date is provided without a time, 23:59:59 is assumed.
If a time is provided without a date, today's date is assumed, even if
the result lies in the future.
.It Fl v
Enable log messages at verbose level or higher.
.It Fl X Ar a.b.c.d Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d/p
Exclude log entries for traffic originating from the specified IPv4
address, range or subnet.
.It Fl x Ar a.b.c.d Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d/p
Exclude log entries for traffic addressed to the specified IPv4
address.
.El
.Pp
Inclusion and exclusion rules are processed left to right.
If the first rule is an inclusion rule, it is interpreted as
.Dq only this range ,
while an initial exclusion rule is interpreted as
.Dq everything except this range .
Subsequent rules are applied to the result of the preceding ones.
.Pp
If no files were specified on the command line, the
.Nm
utility will read data from
.Va stdin
instead.
