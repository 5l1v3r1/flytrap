.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads log data generated by
.Xr flytrap 8
and outputs the same data in the Internet Storm Center's DShield submission format.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl h
Print a usage message and exit.
.It Fl i Ar a.b.c.d
Include log entries for traffic originating from the specified IPv4
address.
.It Fl i Ar a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h
Include log entries for traffic originating from the specified range
of IPv4 addresses.
.It Fl i Ar a.b.c.d/p
Include log entries for traffic originating from the specified IPv4
subnet.
.It Fl o Ar output
Write to the specified file instead of
.Va stdout .
.It Fl r Ar recipient
When printing an email header, use the specified recipient instead of
.Aq Mt reports@dshield.org .
Only valid in conjunction with the
.Fl s
option.
.It Fl s Ar sender
Print an email header before the log data, so the output can be passed
directly to an email submission client such as
.Xr mailx 1 .
.It Fl u Ar userid
Use the specified DShield user ID instead of 0.
This option is required if the
.Fl s
option is used.
.It Fl x Ar a.b.c.d
Exclude log entries for traffic originating from the specified IPv4
address.
.It Fl x Ar a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h
Exclude log entries for traffic originating from the specified range
of IPv4 addresses.
.It Fl x Ar a.b.c.d/p
Exclude log entries for traffic originating from the specified IPv4
subnet.

.Pp
Inclusion and exclusion rules are processed left to right.
If the first rule is an inclusion rule, it is interpreted as
.Dq only this range ,
while an initial exclusion rule is interpreted as
.Dq everything except this range .
Subsequent rules are applied to the result of the preceding ones.
.Pp
If no files were specified on the command line, the
.Nm
utility will read data from
.Va stdin
instead.
