.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon attempts to detect port scanners and, if possible, slow them
down by forging responses to keep them occupied.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d
Enable log messages at debug level or higher.
.It Fl e Ar addr
Use the specified Ethernet address instead of the hardcoded default.
.It Fl f
Foreground mode: do not daemonize and do not create a pidfile.
.It Fl I Ar a.b.c.d Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d/p
Process and respond to packets originating from the specified IPv4
address, range or subnet.
.It Fl i Ar a.b.c.d Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d/p
Process and respond to packets addressed to the specified IPv4
address, range or subnet.
.It Fl n
Dry-run mode.
Does everything except inject packets into the network.
.It Fl o
Log outgoing packets as well as incoming ones.
Use this option with great care, especially in a system that takes
automatic action (blackhole routing, for instance) based on
.Nm
logs.
.It Fl p Ar pidfile
Write the daemon's PID to the specified file instead of
.Pa /var/run/flytrap.pid .
.It Fl t Ar csvfile
Write information about received traffic in CSV format to the specified
file instead of
.Pa @FT_CSVFILE@ .
.It Fl v
Enable log messages at verbose level or higher.
.It Fl X Ar a.b.c.d Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d/p
Ignore packets originating from the specified IPv4 address, range or
subnet.
.It Fl x Ar a.b.c.d Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h Ns | Ns Ar a.b.c.d/p
Ignore packets addressed to the specified IPv4 address, range or
subnet.
.El
.Pp
The final argument is the name of the network interface on which
.Nm
should listen for packets.
.Pp
Judicious use of the
.Fl i
and
.Fl x
options may be required on platforms where
.Xr pcap 3
does not capture outgoing traffic, as
.Nm
will see incoming ARP requests for its host's IP addresses, but not
the replies.
.Pp
Inclusion and exclusion rules are processed left to right.
If the first rule is an inclusion rule, it is interpreted as
.Dq only this range ,
while an initial exclusion rule is interpreted as
.Dq everything except this range .
Subsequent rules are applied to the result of the preceding ones.
.Pp
Log messages are written to the standard error stream when running
in the foreground
.Pq Fl f
and the system log otherwise.
